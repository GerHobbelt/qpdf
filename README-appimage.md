# Using the QPDF AppImage bundle (for Linux x86_64 systems only)

First advice:

- After downloading, you have to set the executable bit for any AppImage (for security reasons
  this is disabled by default):   `chmod +x <name-of-application>.AppImage`

- Run the QPDF AppImage with the '--usage' parameter to start learning some useful details about
  built-in features of this specific AppImage.


More tips:

- You can rename the AppImage to any name allowed for file names on Linux. The '.AppImage' suffix
  is not required for it to function. It will also work as expected if you invoke it from a 
  symlink. Using 'qpdf' as its filename or symlink name is OK.
